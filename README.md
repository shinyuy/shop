## shop
Fashion shop web app. This is a shopping cart created with ReactJS, NodeJS and MongoDB with role based authentication, with the admin
having the ability to create edit and delete products, while users can add and remove products from their cart among other things. 
The front end ReactJS part found in the client folder, and the backend NodeJS in the server folder.
I am still working on this, so to say it is still very far from good, but to see and test the working part so far do the following:

## git clone https://github.com/shinyuy/shop.git
## cd shop
## npm install
This will set up the server and all required packages.
Next, cd into client folder and do:
cd client
## npm install
With this all required packages for front and back end should get installed.
Next, in the root directory run:
## npm run server
This should start both front and back end of the application with the help of concurrently.
